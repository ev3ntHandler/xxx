If you had any experience with webgames growing up, what you are seeing right now will most likely feel familiar to you. This yellow car is from a game known most commonly as FFX Runner, though others might know it as On The Run. Other titles include Alias Runner, FFED Runner, Anonymous Jogger and Accomplish The Departure.
In the history of gaming there have been thousands, possibly millions of racing webgames but none has been as critically acclaimed and as beloved as FFX Runner. 
To this day FFX Runner is still regarded as one of the contenders of the greatest, most iconic webgame ever made. 

*normal footage of FFX Runner, music playing*

But wait, so what exactly is FFX Runner?  

*footage blurs, images of the player and enemy vehicles are shown* 

The synopsis of FFX Runner is very simple: You drive a small yellow car and must escape the aggressive pursuit of the much larger enemy vehicles. 

*footage unblurs, this time the AI is way overaggressive* 

Over the course of the game, more enemy vehicles will spawn, ramping up the difficulty. To escape these enemy vehicles the player must go through the open world map, collecting enough health and fuel to be able to make it to the exit. And once you make it through the exit…

*footage of railroad closing, slowed down, annoying screeching sound added on*

Most beginners end up panicking at this point as they must make their way back around the city and reach the railroad again, now without most of the fuel and health orbs that they picked up in the first lap. With the crossing gate open, the player rushes through to the outskirts of town, making a mad dash through a river canal to just barely make your escape past a speeding train, making for a truly hellish first time experience.

This is where the brilliance of Officine Pixel, the creator of this game, truly starts to shine, as FFX Runner's enemy vehicles featured state of the art artificial intelligence - the first of its' kind in the gaming industry. Via the implementation of a deep learning AI system analyzing the driving patterns of real cartel drivers and hitmen, the developer, Officine Pixel devised multiple unique driver personalities with their own movement, pathing, and reactions to player input.  This revolutionary system was only made possible due to a partnership with The Pentagon's cybersecurity division and NVIDIA's processing division, allowing access to real gang crime statistics fed into NVIDIA's supercomputers. After the AI was fully trained and ready to kill, it was tested in a real-world situation where the AI was fed into a Tesla auto-driving car which proceeded to kamikaze into an oil freighter, proving the sheer destructive capacity of such an intelligence. The dangerous AI was then fully contained by the confines of the FFX Runner simulation, where it proceeds to sate its bloodlust via the incessant massacre of millions of player's vehicles.

To understand why FFX Runner is so beloved you must understand that prior to its' release in 2004 there was nothing else like it, the combination of state of the art AI, the beautiful and almost poetic gameplay, and stunning post-modernist visuals, made it a smash hit amongst everyone ranging from casual gamers to even the harshest critics all around the world. The webgame got so popular that it received demand for a number of ports to standalone platforms, such as PC, IOS, Android, and a variety of smart devices.

*footage for each platform, last one is a car thermostat*

This sudden rise is marked by one of the biggest Shockwave game websites back in the day, GhettoGames3D.com to award it Game of the Year status in 2005.

Officine Pixel had gained a status as a true visionary of this generation having shocked the entire web game market. Shortly after this prestigious trophy was achieved, Officine Pixel started to tease a Game of the Year edition of FFX Runner on his website.

*screenshots of a fake GOTY edition show up"

However, the project would abruptly end after a coder hired by Officine Pixel was seriously injured. Officine Pixel had this to say in a 2005 interview:

"We deeply apologize for the lack of news regarding the development of FFX Runner: Game Of The Year Edition. We are remorseful to announce the fact that our sole programmer was diagnosed with a severe bowel affliction and was unfortunately discovered to be missing multiple sections of intestine following a 32 hour toilet session. Continued development of the title is sadly no longer possible, and the project is now considered canceled."

Despite the failure of the Game of the Year version, it would mark a streak for Officine in terms of consistency and work ethic, with FFX Runner’s fanbase multiplying day by day. The constant success of FFX Runner eventually caught the interest of one of the biggest webgame sites, Miniclip. They had Officine Pixel rename FFX Runner to On The Run and add Miniclip logos in various places ingame. After its' debut on Miniclip FFX Runner was flooded with a new wave of fans and appreciation, further solidifying its' position as one of the most important and recognizable webgames ever made.

*footage of On The Run being played on Miniclip, possibly modded, fake games in the recommended section*

Officine Pixel’s work ethic paid off and the popularity of FFX Runner could not be understimated. By 2007 a survey conducted by the Worldwide Epicsauce Society shows that FFX Runner was rated the best webgame of all time by over 75% of all 49580 participants.

*image of survey results shown on screen*

FFX Runner received many awards and nominations at various award shows, the most remarkable achievement being the Most Comfortable Grass award given out by The Brotherhood of People Who Are Not Garden Gnomes. By 2009 FFX Runner was met with widespread critical acclaim, receiving a 99.0097% rating from Rotten Tomatoes and a 9.921 from Pitchfork. Gary Smoodge wrote in his game review “It’s clear how influential FFX Runner will be to the culture and politics of Moldova”.

*rotten tomatoes and pitchfork rating on screen,  gary smoodge quote*

Since then, FFX Runner and its' greatness have influenced many of the world's most talented and famous people, a legacy still developing to this day. Most notably figures such as DJ Khaled, Fred Durst and Billy Danze of Mash Out Posse who have both been seen wearing FFX Runner and Officine Pixel related merch before.

*images of both DJ Khaled and Billy Danze edited to have FFX Runner shirt designs show up*

When asked about his opinion about Officine Pixel in a 2016 interview, DJ Khaled had this to say:

"...Officine Pixel is family, absolutely. They the best in the game. If I could make a video game it would look like FFX Runner. Officine Pixel is an inspiration and you can hear that in the MUSIC!"

DJ Khaled, specifically, has had an extensive working relationship with Officine Pixel and FFX Runner, most recently including a remix of the FFX Runner Theme Song produced by Khaled himself.

*put video of DJ Khaled on the MPC but the audio is replaced with a shitty trap remix of FFX runner plays, 4 trillion dj Khaled tags*

Theres no way of talking about FFX Runner’s legacy without also mentioning its extensive speed running scene. FFX Runner’s fast paced gameplay makes it a great game for speedrunners, to the point of becoming a staple of the Games Done Quick events streamed live by famous players such as Guy, DirkAmdam, DreamyRunnerFFX, THISISACRYFORHELP45 and the current world record holder - FFXTentacion. 

Displayed here is the video of the current world record run.

*GDQ run shown, ear piercing loud fast mechanical keyboard SFX edited*

This clip showcases how developed the FFX speedrunning is. FFXTentacion makes use of a frame perfect Vertical Hyperpause Framebooster that preserves and multiplies the player's upwards velocity, followed by multiple frame perfect Forwards Superpause Lagmaxxing Rocketboosters to overload the game's input system resulting in great forwards momentum. 
However, there is a new run currently being verified which if proven to be legitimate would surpass the current world record.

*run shown, terrible quality, muffled audio, 2 fps*

There is no doubt that the speedrunning community of FFX Runner is special. Simply by taking a look at its' record holders you can tell the sheer amount of endurance, dedication and talent present in the space, and theres simply no way to do it the amount of justice it deserves in this video.

10 years after FFX Runner's original release, the divine Officine Pixel released a remastered version of the game named FFX Runner HD. It included many new improvements and features with the most notable being a completely reworked framework of the cars, mechanical upgrades, state of the art RTX lighting and procedural generation of various areas of the map.
When starting a new game, the player is given a list of vehicles, only two of which can be purchased with your starting funds - the 1994 Ford Model P or the classic yellow hatchback.

*car selection screen shown*

After choosing their first vehicle, the player is sent to their garage, which acts as the main hub for the game. Here, the player can start a new escape attempt, upgrade their car, or if they have the funds, buy a new one. The player can also choose to sell their car for some extra cash. Beware, however, for if you sell your vehicle and don't have enough cash for a new one, the player will be forced to escape on foot.

*footage of FFX Runner HD being played with a third person character model*

While the core gameplay remains mostly the same, there are some fascinating new twists present, such as the aforementioned procedural generation system used in a newly-added maze area which the player encounters right after crossing the railroad, and a warm surprise for the oldest fans of the game.

As a tribute to the unreleased FFX Runner: Game of The Year Edition, Officine Pixel added a secret mode to FFX Runner HD only accessible by the most dedicated of players - FFX Runner HD: Gold Edition. Gold Edition is not a separate version of the game, but is instead triggered upon the player reaching $1,000,000 in game cash. Upon reaching this number, the player's garage will transform into a mansion filled with supercars, signaling the activation of Gold Edition. The Gold Edition features an all new golden UI as well as other features to allow you to flaunt your wealth, such as the addition of a keybind that lets you throw money out of your car window.

Beware though, for playing in Gold Edition brings higher stakes...

Even when hitting rock bottom, the game never truly ends.  The player is forced to continue playing despite the major disadvantages the player now faces. From this, we can look at a few important details about the game's lore. Many users in the FFX Runner community have theorized that the game takes place in hell, with the gameplay loop serving as a form of eternal, divine punishment for the player. All of these game elements are crafted in such a divine way to craft a raw commentary of the human condition, its almost impossible to imagine FFX Runner being made by a mere mortal.
*show Chinese/Asian paintings of hell or something, have the editing style be more paper cutout*

This is backed up by the fact that the player's car is yellow - representing the Yellow Springs, also known as Huangquan, which is the Chinese underworld. Further investigations on the source code have showed that many elements of the game's lore and visuals are directly linked to Chinese mythology, possibly due to the large role that Officine Pixel allegedly played in destabilizing the Chinese government, this played a role in FFX Runner and all affliations in china being banned and resulting in the death penalty if one is caught playing any one of Officine Pixel's games. 
One such example is Tang Hua, who was painfully tortured via anal fish insertion. Before this, Tang was to go to Detroit in the hopes of becoming a successful car designer for many manufacturers.

*5 second pause, “in memoriam of Tang Hua” on screen*

Many famous figures in history have been discovered to have been previous reincarnations of Officine Pixel, causing the majority of governments worldwide to carry a debt to Him. The scientific community theorize that Officine Pixel is a divine being who created the world and life itself for the sole purpose of making FFX Runner possible.
The train that blocks you from continuing the first time around the city is the game's representation of Meng Po, the goddess of forgetfulness. In Chinese mythology, Meng Po stops souls from entering the cycle of reincarnation without drinking her soup of forgetfulness, causing them to forget the memories of their previous life. Similarly to this, winning FFX Runner represents escaping the underworld, only to be forced to live "another life" in the next run of the game. The train stops you from proceeding until you make the decision to Quote on Quote “forget” the run through the city you just did, drinking the symbolic soup by proceeding through the left tunnel and restarting your run through the city. By wiping your first experience of the city and running through it again, you are "reborn" and allowed to proceed out of the city, the metaphorical underworld in this game. 
The different versions of FFX Runner that have been released also represent the four cardinal beasts of Chinese mythology, the Black Tortoise, Azure Dragon, Vermillion Bird, and White Tiger. The earliest version of the game, Alias Runner, has a fiery red sky and car, an aesthetic that clearly represents the Vermillion Bird. The most widely known version, known as FFX Runner or On The Run, has a bright, clear aesthetic representing the purity of the Azure Dragon. The Japanese exclusive Hiroshima Runner has a violent nuclear backdrop, representing the might and violence of the White Tiger. Finally, FFX Runner: Hobo Edition, the version unlocked by failing in FFX Runner HD: Gold Edition, represents the Black Tortoise because Black people have historically high homelessness rates.
In conclusion it is clear to me that Officine Pixel is the creator of everything. He has created us to live a false metaphysical reality in which we are the yellow car being chased by bigger enemies. This timeline is an illusion and Officine Pixel is the only escape from it. We must forget this earthly realm and enter the euphoria that FFX Runner offers. Amidst all of this suffering and torture there exists a ray of light within the darkness. This will be my final review on youtube—after 17 years of numbness I will finally have my escape from the pain. I am proud to award FFX Runner the greatest award I can-
4,923,391,760,353,128,351,801,803,167,179,533,233,394,1191,178,918,842,654,494,395,398,066,048,118,782,435,198,515,416,155,337,968,876,715,752,677,349,240,548,843,527,330,421,711,518 stars.
